# SSH-Food-sale-Website-Demo
A local test website with struts2,spring3 and hibernate4

Running on the NetBeans,the website is set on the local,and the database too.

I'm in charge of the back-end part,the server is Microsoft SQL Server.

What's more, thanks to the front-end designer,she helps a lot
